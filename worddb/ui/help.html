            			<br>Optionally add your  custom greetings before and/or after the person’s name is announced.
                            The greeting needs to be written in our Ekalipi phonetic script using the custom onscreen keyboard. For further details, please visit our websites ekalipi.org and ekalipi.com
                <br>
				<br>Examples: 
				For incoming calls you can have it say :
                		<ul>
                    			<li><b>English :</b> "Call From" (köl f-röm) before the announcement of the name</li>
                    			<li><b>Marathi :</b> “फोन करित आहे” (fon kareŧ āhλ)  after the announcement of the name</li>
			        	</ul>
				For outgoing calls have it say : 
				<ul>
					<li><b>English :</b> "Now calling" (nå köleŋø) and then the person's name.</li>
					
				</ul>
				<b>Note - For sample greetings in other languages please visit www.ekalipi.com/eca.html</b>
					
					<br><b>Tip –</b> In crowded places, it's hard to know whose phone is ringing. If you add your own name in the greeting e.g. Hey satyakala” (hλ saŧ-yakalā); when you get a call, you and others will know that you are receiving the call and won’t have to check their phones.

To turn the connection off or on between the app and the Bose device, uncheck or check this box.
If there is no connection between the Bose device, the announcement will play through the phone. For privacy reasons (i.e. you do not want others to know who is calling) please check this box. 

</br>
Bose Device Notes:
To turn off frames manually - Close the frames and put them upside down. If you are not going to use the frames for some time, we recommend that you turn off the frames (i.e. upside down), before putting them away.
To hear the ekalipi annoucements only, uncheck voice prompts in the "Bose Connect" app. 
To ensure that the Bluetooth connection between the phone and the Bose Device doesn't break, set Standby Timer to "never".
</br>
Notes:
If your Bose Device is Idle (e.g. if you leave the frames on the table right side up) the connection will automatically disconnect after a long period of inactivity [Idle time out]. 
This time will be even shorter if your phone is connected to 2.4 Ghz wifi connection (i.e. same frequency as Bluetooth). WiFi networks using 5 Ghz do not seem to have this problem. To keep the connection longer, you can turn off wifi on your phone.</br>
</br> If a disconnect does occur, you will hear a message" Bose device disconnected" Please press the the button on the device to reconnect. This reconnection will be successful only if the phone's screen is on.
